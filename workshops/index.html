<p>Workshops are paid trainings in a classroom setting that focus on specific topics and are taught using a hands-on approach. They are very affordable and are a great way to take deep dives into specific aspects of Drupal.</p>

<p>This is the Absolute Beginner's Guide to Drupal.  You'll learn all of the key concepts you need to understand, navigate and begin building a Drupal site.  We've taught new Drupal users from the White House to Harvard and the New York Transit Commission to the small business owner.  We'll help it make sense.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<h2>Panels for Themers - Creating Highly Flexible Layouts</h2>

<p>
Provided by <a href="http://www.chapterthree.com/">Chapter Three</a><br>
When: Saturday 6/22, TBD<br>
Cost: $75
</p>

<p>With the power of Panels, you never have to make a .tpl file ever again! Okay, that's not true at all, but what Panels does give you is the ability you to create Drupal aware layouts that can be reused between dozens of other sites. If you create custom Panel pages per-content type, per-node, per-anything (instead of custom .tpl's for each) you will significantly reduce the number of .tpls you have to keep create and keep track of while saving a significant amount of time. Say goodbye to crowded templates folders!</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>No knowledge of PHP is required, but a willingness to learn and elementary understanding of programming languages is a necessity. Proficiency in CSS and HTML are required for theming, but only an understanding is required for this workshop. Experience with Drupal configuration and use of contributed modules/themes is helpful for understanding the concepts of theme development.</p>

<h2>Getting Stuff into Drupal: Basics of Content Migration</h2>

<p>
Provided by Michael Anello, <a href="http://drupaleasy.com/">Drupal Easy</a><br>
When: Saturday 6/22, TBD<br>
Cost: $75
</p>

<p>Almost anyone with a bit of Drupal knowledge can build a functional Drupal site these days, but what happens when it's time to get the last 5 years of your organization's content into that snazzy new site? More often than not, the solution involves hiring outside help or migrating content manually (ugh). Fortunately, the Drupal community has written some amazing tools to assist with content migration, and this workshop will demonstrate how to utilize them. Examples of migrating data from comma-separated-values files (via the Feeds module), Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 (via the Migrate module), and from an generic MySql database (also via the Migrate module) will form the basis for the workshop. Participants can expect to leave the workshop with confidence that they can tackle their next data migration project.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Participants should have a good base knowledge of Drupal fundamentals for the Feeds migration portion of the workshop. The Migration module examples will involve a generous amount of object-oriented PHP code.</p>

<h2>Launching an Online Store with Commerce Kickstart 2.x</h2>

<p>

When: Saturday 6/22, TBD<br>
Cost: $75
</p>

<p>Drupal Commerce is an open source eCommerce framework developed to help you create unique online shopping experiences. Its core modules provide the basic systems you need to do business online without hard-coding assumptions for any particular business model, allowing you to build sites that meet your business needs instead of getting in your way.</p>

<p>Built on top of Drupal Commerce, Commerce Kickstart 2.0 is a distribution of Drupal that installs a demo store out of the box, implementing a variety of eCommerce best practices and improving the store administrator user experience. It is feature-rich, including numerous contributed modules that add helpful functionality to Drupal Commerce.</p>

<p>In this course, you will learn how to launch your next online store with Commerce Kickstart 2.0 from project creators Commerce Guys. Through a series of alternating lessons and hands-on exercises, you will install the distribution, customize it, and prepare to launch your own fantasy store during this day long training. Handbooks will be provided, but each student should come prepared with a Drupal development environment on a laptop they can use for the duration of the training.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Attendees should have some eCommerce experience and be used to Drupal 7. Prior experience with Views and Rules is not required but is certainly helpful. Students looking to prepare should spend some time reading tutorials or watching videos about Rules 2, Views 3, or Drupal Commerce itself.</p>

<h2>DevOps</h2>

<p>When you set up the environment for a new site, do you start with sudo apt-get, every time. When you deploy your code, do you do it manually, every time? Do you need to work with others but hate how they mess up your code?</p>

<p>Learn how to make the machine do the work. In this course, you’ll practice some “build once, use often” methods to improve collaboration, capture server configuration, and create automation. We’ll do less talk and more doing - with hands-on exercises and examples to build on, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collaborative development</li>
<li>Version control for effective collaboration with Git</li>
<li>Configuration management with Ansible</li>
<li>Automation with Jenkins</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p><strong>You must bring a Mac or Linux laptop.</strong> (Unless you know how to run Ansible on your Windows machine, in which case, you probably know most of what we’ll teach.) Please be comfortable in the command line and have a basic working knowledge of version control, preferably Git.</p>
