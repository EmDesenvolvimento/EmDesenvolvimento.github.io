<h1>Workshops</h1>

<p>Workshops are paid trainings in a classroom setting, which focus on specific topics and teach with a hand-on approach. We make them very affordable and are definitely the way to go if you want to dive deeply into a particular aspect of Drupal.</p>

<p>We're still confirming the workshops that will be available, so stay tuned!</p>
