Have you ever wanted to change the way a content editor enters information in a field? Ever wished you certain field type had autocomplete? Do you wish that all of your link fields would output a button that opened a modal window? You don't need another contrib module to do these things. Custom field widgets and formatters bring total, portable control to the editability and display of existing field types and can be bundled together in a single custom module to be used an any and every site you build.

Questions this sesssion will answer:
* What are field widgets?
* What are field formatters?
* What are some use cases for creating new widgets and formatters?
* Walkthough building a custom module that adds new widgets and formatters to an existing field type.

This session is geared toward the beginner to intemeddiate developer who has written custom modules but hasn't delved into formatters and widgets. Also, a site builder who is begining to pick up some PHP and learn various Drupal API's and hooks.
