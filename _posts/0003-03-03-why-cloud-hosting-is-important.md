Whether you already have a website or are planning on starting one, I’m sure by now you’ve heard the term “cloud hosting” buzzing around. Cloud hosting is an effective technology, but how exactly does it work?

Imagine a world with virtually NO site crashes, outrageous costs or limited site availability…this kind of world is a reality when you turn to the cloud for your hosting needs. Cloud hosting sites use virtual resources of a group of interconnected servers; this “group” is what we call the cloud. What this means it that instead of having limited options among which servers will host your site, data is rendered from various servers.

You never have to worry about your site crashing because if one server does crash, there is always another server within the cloud that will pick up the slack and keep your site up and running! This kind of peace of mind is not always a guarantee when using solely dedicated hosting. Cloud hosting makes things simple to manage without compromising on quality.

Hosting your site on the cloud is also extremely cost efficient. Unlike dedicated server hosting, cloud hosting gives you endless possibilities as far as capacity is concerned. We give you the option of hosting on the cloud so that you’ll never have the fear of running out of space…there is ALWAYS more readily available and waiting to be used! We make it easy to see how much it’ll cost according to your site’s needs, which you’ll realize is the most decent price around.
