Maps are useful. Just ask anyone who has ever used a map to find anything. Even more useful are maps in Drupal.

Want to build a user map? How about a store locator? These are popular mapplications and in this session you will learn how to build both.

Maps in Drupal stay true to the "Drupal way" of using content types, fields, and views. So you'll be able to take your existing site building knowledge and apply it to map-making.

Once you "get" how mapping works through these real-world walkthroughs, you'll be able to build your own maps for your own purposes. Like the rest of Drupal, if you can imagine it, you can build it.

Now, you may have heard that working with maps in Drupal is a headache. Not so. After building a map in Drupal, your head will feel like it has been massaged by Guillaume Delisle.

When your next client asks for a store locator or other fancy mapplication, you can feel good about replying with a confident, "yep, we can do that. no probs."

This session will benefit any level of site builder who hasn't yet learned how to use maps.
