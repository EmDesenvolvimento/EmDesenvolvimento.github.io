Views is a important part of most Drupal sites. When should you use it? What do you do when it isn't performant?

We will talk about what Views does and when it should be used. We will touch on Drupal content architecture, MySQL queries and Views performance.

We will talk about alternatives to Views for better performance. Alternatives such as Drupal Database API (DBTNG), static queries and Entity queries.

This session is aimed at intermediate to advanced site builders or anyone who uses Views and wants options to use in addition to Views.

You should walk away with a better understanding of Views, how it works, when to use it and what to use in situations when better performance is needed.
