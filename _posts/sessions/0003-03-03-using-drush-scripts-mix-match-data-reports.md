This talk will demonstrate some benefits of writing custom scripts using Drush. In addition to scripting site building tasks, Drush can be used to mix and match data from Drupal's database with data not otherwise available to Drupal, such as archived server logs. As an example, this talk we explain the evolution of a Drush script for aggregating data used in conversion optimization.
