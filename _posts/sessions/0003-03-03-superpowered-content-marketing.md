This presentation will discuss best practices for using Drupal as a content marketing tool - including the best modules for easy scheduling and implementation, as well as the benefits of Drupal's signature responsive design features, and mentions into new developments with mobile content integration and marketing automation add-on services.

The target audience is anyone in the Drupal community who wants to better understand the needs, wants and strategies of production and content development teams using Drupal websites. While the following example is general in nature, the presentation will include the theories in this article, from a Drupal-specific angle. Please note that I chose this angle for the topic because this event will be taking place exactly one week after the release of the Superman summer blockbuster Man of Steel (and its expected huge marketing campaign), and will therefore likely seem quite timely. http://www.volacci.com/blog/chris-gaffney/2013/april/22/superpowered-digital-content-marketing
