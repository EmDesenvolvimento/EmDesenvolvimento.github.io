This session would be geared towards Drupal theme developers. They would walk away with a basic understanding of how one can integrate a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Foundation) with Drupal. They would also get a quick tour on how they can use Grunt to save them time, and get ideas on how to implement font icon systems in their themes.
