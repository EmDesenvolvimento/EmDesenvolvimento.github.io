This presentation will cover a number of ways Drupal can interface to the "real world", meaning the world beyond it's database and the browser page. Reading data from a variety of sensors using the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other platforms will be demostrated, as well as sending out commands that turn on and off lights, motors, and open doors.

It is common for big Drupal sites to interface with a variety of external APIs, for everything from mail handling and social media to importing complex data from other web applications such as CRMs (SalesForce, ExactTarget, etc). However we have not fully explored how Drupal can allow us to interface with APIs that actually measure atoms and move them.

The presentation will take the form of a series of quick overviews of a variety of projects. If logistics allow demos will be offered, or else they will be available at a separate BoF.
