We were hired by a Dallas real estate broker to enhance her online search visibility. After fighting the good war with off-page SEO, link wheels, off-shoring link builders, and enormous Adwords spends, we turned to the website itself.

What we found was with all of the recent search algorithm changes with Google, the best practice approach to beating the competitors was to make your real estate website as friendly as possible to Google. And when Google loves you more than your competitor, you beat them.

### Do you want to learn how?

Drupal is a natural fit to win the real estate sales war in hyperlocal markets. In this session, you'll learn about:

1. Integrating RETS (or, IDX) feeds into Drupal entities as real estate listings;
2. Customizing real estate listing pages within Drupal;
3. Making those listings help you win the long tail search battles;
4. "Must Have" Search Engine Optimization things to do;
5. Social media sharing and advanced social media techniques using Drupal;
6. Photo gallery techniques;
7. Site performance ideas.

We'll spend about half the time discussing strategy. The other half will be spent showing real world examples of how to access a RETS (Real Estate Transaction Standard) service like the North Texas Real Estate Information System (NTREIS); how to format entities and fields for superior front end display; SEO tricks with Drupal; Social Media tricks; and we'll touch on server high performance strategies, which are important to win the local game.

Real estate marketing is the single highest competitive space in the Internet marketing space. No matter how small the city, community, or town is, the Adwords bids for real estate keywords are higher than all other terms. To perform well, the broker and the broker's marketing agency or employee has to have the knowledge and platform to win. You'll walk away with a framework of how to win this war using Drupal.

If you have a search engine marketing challenge in any industry, you will enjoy this presentation.
