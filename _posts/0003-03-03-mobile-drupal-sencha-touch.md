There is little question that mobile is the way of the future when it comes to web applications. This mobile wave is so powerful, that it is changing the very paradigm on how websites are to be constructed. "Mobile First" is the terminology used to describe how we must learn to adapt to this wave by considering the mobile uses for you website before you even begin to consider how someone may use it within a desktop browser. And it is very apparent that this wave has taken hold of the Drupal community. Within this community, there is much talk about how we can build themes to be responsive to mobile devices so that they are usable within a mobile browser, but little attention has been placed on how we can solve the mobile problem using native mobile applications. The reason is simply because native mobile application development is very fractious in that every mobile device has different development SDK's and environments. Enter Sencha Touch ...

In this presentation, Travis will walk you though a technology that allows you to build a scalable web application that can easily be compiled to a responsive native mobile application using the Apache Cordova project. Sencha Touch basically provides a robust MVC framework to create large-scale mobile applications while still maintaining responsive UI within a mobile device; all while using web standards such as JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
