Need a solution for a professional society, membership-driven association, or a non-profit organization that handles contact management, membership renewals, bulk email, event registration, and more?

CiviCRM is a web-based, open source, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) software for non-profit and other civic-sector organizations. CiviCRM integrates easily with Drupal and together they provide a robust feature set within one integrated solution for contact management, fundraising, event management, member management, mass e-mail marketing, peer-to-peer campaigns, case management, and much more.

Learn about the core modules, functionality, extensibility, and out-of-the-box configuration. Focus is on getting the most functionality without lots of investment.
