Howdy everyone, the DrupalCamp Austin site is up and running! It’s a bit different than in years past but we’ve put a lot of TLC into this site and we think you’ll love using it.

### What’s different?

For starters, we’ve taken some critical functionality off our site and used other dedicated services to handle certain things. The main two are:

* Registration is [handled through EventBrite](http://drupalcampaustin.eventbrite.com/)
* Session submissions are [handled through Google docs](http://bit.ly/drupalatx-speak)

You may be thinking "wat.. Drupal can do this" and you’re not wrong, but we wanted to change things up this year so we could focus on building more awesome features made just for YOU!

For now, check out the [currently submitted sessions](/sessions), [read about the program and venue](/about), or if you have a question [check out the FAQs](/faq).

See you soon!
