Howdy everyone, the DrupalCamp Austin site is up and running! It’s a bit different than in years past but we’ve put a lot of TLC into this site and we think you’ll love using it.

### What’s different?

For starters, we’ve taken some critical functionality off our site and used other dedicated services to handle certain things. The main two are:

* Registration is [handled through EventBrite](http://drupalcampaustin.eventbrite.com/)
* Session submissions are [handled through Google docs](http://bit.ly/drupalatx-speak)

You may be thinking "wat.. Drupal can do this" and you’re not wrong, but we wanted to change things up this year so we could focus on the following awesome stuff made just for YOU!

### New hotness

* Mobile friendly site — Yes, although [DrupalCamp Austin 2011](http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/) was super lightweight and responsive, we knew we could do better this year. Everything has been stripped down to the bone so that you can load the site quick and get to your next session without waiting on silly images or slideshows.
* Schedule — we’ve got some really nice goodies planned for the schedule, so stay tuned as the event comes closer.

For now, check out the [currently submitted sessions](/sessions), [read about the program and venue](/about), or if you have a question [check out the FAQs](/faq). See you soon!
