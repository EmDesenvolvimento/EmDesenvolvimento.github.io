Five years ago I showed up at Drupal Camp Austin and gave this talk:

[Drupal in the Cloud](http://www.chapterthree.com/videos/drupal-cloud)

Subsequently, I went off with some partners and started a company to realize that vision. Needless to say, a lot of lessons have been learned along the way.

In this session, I'll tell you exactly how we applied cloud principles and built a platform that's supporting thousands of Drupal developers working on tens of thousands of sites, serving over 2 Billion pages a month. All with a consistent platform and architecture.
