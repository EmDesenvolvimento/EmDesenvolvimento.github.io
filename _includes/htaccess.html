### This is the .htaccess file

Everything that you want in .htaccess should instead be placed inside the raw
tags below. Included are some very simple examples to provide context and to
demonstrate how you can keep snooping eyes from reading the plaintext file that
is generated by Jekyll.

General advice on .htaccess files can be found all over the web.

### How can Apache see this?

You need to create a symlink to the generated copy of this file. Starting from
the root of a Jekyll site, it should look something like this:

```
cd /path/to/jekyll/root
ln -s _site/htaccess.txt _site/.htaccess
```

There is already a .gitignore entry for ```_site/.htaccess``` in this repo.
You can create this symlink on your production Apache server and be good to go.
