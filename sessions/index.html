<h1>Sessions</h1>

<p>Like other DrupalCamps, the presentations at our event come from you&mdash;members of the Drupal community. DrupalCamp Austin is an excellent opportunity to teach others about the interesting code, design, or client projects you've solved using Drupal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development</li>
  <li>Design and UX</li>
  <li>Business</li>
  <li>Site building</li>
  <li>gov/npo/edu</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to submit a talk</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sessions are placed into 50-minute time slots and you should plan on using the full amount of time. If you finish early, you can field questions from the audience.</li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="#submitted-sessions" title="View the submitted sessions">submitted sessions</a> below to view the talks that have already proposed.</li>
  <li>The last day to submit a session will be on Sunday, May 19th at 11:59pm CT.</li>
  <li>The proposals will be reviewed by the organizers and we'll post the final schedule during the week of May 27th.</li>
